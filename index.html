        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>The AquaSense project aims to provide real-time monitoring of water quality parameters, including Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), temperature, and Electrical Conductivity (EC). Water quality is a critical aspect of environmental health, agriculture, and various industrial processes. Monitoring these parameters ensures the safety and efficiency of water usage.</p>
        
        <p>The AquaSense website offers users the ability to monitor and track TDS, temperature, and EC levels in water bodies such as lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. Using sensors and IoT devices, the project continuously collects data and updates it in real-time on this website.</p>

        <p>The project leverages Firebase Realtime Database to store and retrieve data seamlessly. Firebase offers a scalable and reliable platform for real-time data synchronization, allowing users to access the most recent water quality measurements instantly.</p>

        <p>With AquaSense, users can stay informed about the quality of water resources, enabling them to make informed decisions about water usage, conservation, and environmental management. Whether it's for recreational activities, agricultural irrigation, or industrial processes, real-time monitoring of water quality is essential for sustainable water management.</p>
